# Code Book for Tidy Dataset
## Identifying Variables
1. subject: integer from 1 to 30, represents the volunteer ID
2. activity: six descriptive activity names
   - WALKING
   - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   - SITTING
   - STANDING
   - LAYING

## Measurement Variables
All remaining variables are averaged sensor measurements, including:
- Time domain body acceleration mean and standard deviation
- Time domain gravity acceleration mean and standard deviation
- Time domain gyroscope mean and standard deviation
- Frequency domain body acceleration and gyroscope mean and standard deviation

Variable names have been simplified and clarified:
- Prefix `time` for time domain signals
- Prefix `frequency` for frequency domain signals
- Acc = Accelerometer
- Gyro = Gyroscope
- Mag = Magnitude

## Data Summary
All values in the tidy dataset are the average of original measurements grouped by subject and activity.
